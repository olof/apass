Hacking
-------
This is an attempt to formalize how to contribute to this application.
Follow the coding style used in the code, it shouldn't be too hard.
Tabs for indentation, space for alignment. Curly brackets on the same
line as... you know.

I appreciate if you use git when supplying patches, but, of course,
that's not a requirement. In any case, a commit/patch should solve one
thing and one thing only. When working with git, create a seperate
branch everytime you want to change something. The name of the branch
should be:

 topic/<short description, a title of what you are doing>

E.g.

 topic/fix_failing_db_init_test

If you are trying to solve an open ticket, it's a good idea to include
the ticket number in the branch name. E.g.

 topic/fix_failing_db_init_test-1234
